## The Core Team
The interdisciplinary team has a strong track record (funded by Vetenskapsrådet, Vinnova, Formas, etc) of building end-to-end software platforms including high bandwidth automotive multimodal data collection, large-scale data management and automated annotation, front-end implementation and UX design, as well as traffic safety research, intersectional disability research, and traffic medicine. We are committed to advancing the field of AI-driven traffic safety by developing innovative solutions that are both user-friendly and inclusive.
